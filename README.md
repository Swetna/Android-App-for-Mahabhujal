The Android App we have created is a simple Userfriendly design with various forms to collect data from our volunteers and users in Yedshi village regarding various features of the well and borewell such as the water level,quality of water, forms to register new borewell etc.Besides the data on well and borewell we have also collected data about the amount of rainfall in the area,
recharge structures to help understand the total water usage and requirement for various well and borewell.
We are also creating a map along with various filters to show the functional and non-functional wells and borewells. Our Android Application will be a smart and easy way for the people of Yedshi village to enter in data and predict the time period of availability of water based on the amount of rainfall in the region and the usage of water.
The Android App is connected to the Django Backend where all the data coming from the website and the application will be stored.
