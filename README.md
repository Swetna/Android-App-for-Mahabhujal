The Android App we have created is a simple Userfriendly design with various forms to collect data from our volunteers and users in Yedshi village regarding various features of the well and borewell such as the water level,quality of water, forms to register new borewell etc.Besides the data on well and borewell we have also collected data about the amount of rainfall in the area,
recharge structures to help understand the total water usage and requirement for various well and borewell.
We are also creating a map along with various filters to show the functional and non-functional wells and borewells. Our Android Application will be a smart and easy way for the people of Yedshi village to enter in data and predict the time period of availability of water based on the amount of rainfall in the region and the usage of water.
The Android App is connected to the Django Backend where all the data coming from the website and the application will be stored.

The app consists of a login page where the users can register, login via email & password or google authentication.
Logging into the app opens up the Home page where the map with a marker on Yeshi village our focused area is shown.
There are various forms available in the app to register well/borewell, add the water level, add borewell struct level,Pumping hours of the wel/borewell, Borewell/Well section where an image of the borewell/well is added along with the respective code.
We also have forms for collection of various rain related data such as the amount of rainfall in the region at the particular date also the station details where the rainfall amount was collected and measured.
There is seperate for through which the water quality of the well/borewell can be added to understand what could be the purpose of the respective well or borewell.
The app consists of a dashboard where various pie charts are visible showing the function/non functional well and borewells, their usage and ownership.
We also have added a bar graph showing the amount of rainfall in the region in 2020 based on actual data.
Based on the usage of water in the region our demand analysis page provides details of the water being extracted based on daily,weekly,monthly,yearly.Also shows the ground water remaining as per our prediction.
Our recharge structure page not only helps in adding data about a recharge structure but also helps in calculating the need and volume and display the results.
